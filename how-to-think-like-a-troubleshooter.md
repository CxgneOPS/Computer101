# How to Think Like a Troubleshooter

Technical knowledge is important — but mindset is what separates a good technician from someone who guesses.

Effective troubleshooting is not about random fixes. It is about structured thinking.

## Start With the Problem, Not the Assumption

When a user reports an issue:

- What exactly is happening?
- When did it start?
- What changed recently?
- Is the issue constant or intermittent?

Clear information prevents unnecessary work.

## Break the System Into Parts

Every computer issue belongs to one of a few categories:

- Power
- Hardware
- Operating system
- Application
- Network
- User input

Instead of treating the system as one large problem, isolate which part may be failing.

## Eliminate Variables

A strong troubleshooter:

- Tests one theory at a time
- Changes one variable at a time
- Verifies results before moving on

Guessing creates confusion. Isolation creates clarity.

---

## Think Input → Process → Output

Almost every issue can be framed as:

- Is the system receiving the correct input?
- Is it processing correctly?
- Is it producing the expected output?

This simple structure helps narrow down the failure point quickly.

---

## Verify and Document

Once resolved:

- Confirm the issue is fully fixed
- Ensure no side effects were introduced
- Document the steps taken

Documentation improves consistency and speeds up future resolutions.

## Final Thought

Good troubleshooting is not about knowing everything.

It is about thinking clearly, isolating variables, and solving problems methodically.
